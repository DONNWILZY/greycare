Medical History: If your application needs to store detailed medical histories for patients, consider adding fields or a subdocument for medical history information such as previous illnesses, surgeries, medications, and allergies.

Emergency Contacts: You may want to include a schema for emergency contact information, allowing users to specify contacts in case of emergencies.

Billing and Payment History: If your application handles billing and payments, consider a schema for billing history and payment records.

Patient Documents: If you need to store and manage patient documents (e.g., medical reports, prescriptions), consider adding a schema for documents with appropriate metadata.

Patient Portal: If your application offers a patient portal for accessing medical records and test results, you might need additional schemas to handle portal-related data.

Chat or Messaging: If your application includes a chat or messaging feature, you might need schemas for chat messages and conversations.

Appointments History: If you want to maintain a history of past appointments, you could add a schema for appointments history.

Permissions and Access Control: Depending on your application's complexity, you might need a schema for defining permissions and access control rules for different roles.
